# Python_API

# Project 2 - Python Data API 

This project is focused on building a data API in Python. This service will allow us to create, retrieve and delete posts for our journal. 

## Docs

### Get an entry

Get the details of a specific journal entry, given the *entryid*

**URL** : `/diaryentry/<entryid>`

**Method** : `GET`

### Get all entries

Get the details of all journal entries

**URL** : `/diaryentry`

**Method** : `GET`

### Create a new entry

Create a new diary entry in our journal

**URL** : `/diaryentry`

**Method** : `POST`

Provide details of entry to be created.

```json
{
    "title": "string",
    "description": "string"
}
```

### IF statement explanation

Created new variable called gratitude_theme which takes the new_entry's description.
Then IF/ELIF/ELSE flow to check if user input gratitude_theme is equal to 4 different variables and based on whichever variable the user has inputted the success message changes.

In order for the message to be received and displayed to the user we had to edit the create-entry.html file line 131 document.querySelector('#success-msg') we added remove to hidden so its visible for the user. 

 #### Example
 
 if gratitude_theme == "Myself":
		response = {
		'message': 'What have you got to be grateful for?',
		'data': new_entry,
		'unique_id': unique_id
		}



## Deployment

Steps:
1. Sign up for an account with your email at https://www.pythonanywhere.com/registration/register/beginner/
2. Click on "End Tour"
3. Once you're in the main screen, click on the **Web** tab 
4. Click on Create new web app 
5. Click on Next
6. Select **Flask**
7. IMPORTANT: Select Python 3.8 
8. Rename the file to **app.py**
9. You should now have a basic Flask API setup! 
10. Upload/overwrite the app.py file with our Sublime text files from our computers 
11. Upload the database.JSON file to your file list
12. Hit Save + Click the little refresh button
13. Test the API!!!
14. Create a Bash Console from the Pythonanywhere page (Way to interact with a computer through typing)
15. Create a virtual environment using: `mkvirtualenv venv --python=/usr/bin/python3.8`
16. Once you're in your virtual environment, run `pip install flask-cors`
17. Update your virtualenv in the **Web** tab as `/home/{username}/.virtualenvs/venv` 
18. Uncomment the lines related to CORS in app.py
19. Save, Refresh and then reload web app 
20. Test the API! You're done!

We will deploy our API using pythonanywhere.com, which will allow us to easily expose our API to the public.
